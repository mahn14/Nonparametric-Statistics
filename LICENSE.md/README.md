# Nonparametric-Statistics
Classwork and Assignments from STAT 3504 at Virginia Tech

This repo contains code given by the professor Dr. Gramacy (http://bobby.gramacy.com/).
Many of the statistical methods implemented as a function were presented in class, with minor changes for completing homeworks.
Examples of class code, the raw homework questions, and exams can be found on his website. 

These solutions are posted as was submitted for grading, without changes or corrections, during my time in this class.

Feel free to use and study any code as long as it isn't considered cheating by your school!
